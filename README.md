# Better Calibrator
This is meant to make calibration easier. I had enough time on my hands to make this and I would rather have a simpler calibration process. Manually adjusting numbers in a text box is usable, but not user friendly or quick. I need to recalibrate my tablet so often with constantly changing conditions and locations. This plugin was made by using [PSSA](https://github.com/jamesbt365/PSSA) as a template for getting started with plugins, thanks to jamesbt365. Also, thanks to [Tablet_Calibration](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Tablet_Calibration/tree/main) by Kuuuube for code that converts tablet units.

## How to Use
After installing the plugin, disable the filter. Then, go to the directory where its installed (on linux its usually ~/.config/OpenTabletDriver/Plugin/BetterCalibrator). Run calibrator.x86_64, tap the center of each target with your pen. After you click the last target, the calibrator program will save the configuration. Now you can re-enable the filter. The configuration will automatically load and you will get calibrated output.


## Supported Platforms

[] Windows

[] MacOS

I don't have a Mac or Windows device to test this on, so I wont be trying too hard to add support for it. I can't even compile for Mac as I don't own any apple computers.
