# Better Calibrator
## A plugin for OpenTabletDriver
This is mean to make calibration easier. I had enough time on my hands to make this and I would rather have a simpler calibration process. Manually adjusting numbers in a text box is usable, but not user friendly or quick. I need to recalibrate my tablet so often with constantly changing conditions and locations. This plugin was made by using [PSSA](https://github.com/jamesbt365/PSSA) as a template for getting started with plugins, thanks to jamesbt365.

## Supported Platforms

- [ ] Windows
- [x] Linux
- [ ] MacOS

I don't have a Mac or Windows device to test this on, so I wont be trying too hard to add support for it. I can't even compile for Mac as I don't own any apple computers.

I am open to pull requests if you want to add support for your platform.
